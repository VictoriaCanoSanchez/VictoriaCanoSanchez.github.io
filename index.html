                    <p>Welcome! I am a postdoctoral language researcher at the
                        Universitat
                        de les Illes Balears (UIB) and a member of the
                        BASLA Linguistics research group. I also teach Spanish as a Foreign Language (ELE)
                        at UIB's International Center for Spanish studies (CIEE), a center certified by
                        the Instituto Cervantes.</p> 
                    
                    <p>My research lies at
                        the
                        intersection of psycholinguistics and cognitive aging,
                        with a
                        particular focus on how language is processed and
                        maintained across
                        the lifespan. I currently collaborate with Prof. Pedro
                        Guijarro on
                        the project <i>Language Loss and End-State
                            Acquisition</i>, which
                        investigates language decline and stabilization in late
                        bilingualism.</p>

                    <p>To explore this topic, I use a wide range of statistical,
                        behavioral, and experimental methods to better
                        understand language
                        processing, with a strong emphasis on eye-tracking and,
                        more
                        recently, electroencephalography (EEG) methods. I have
                        also worked
                        with a wide range of populations—including young and
                        older adults,
                        monolinguals, bilinguals, and currently, heritage
                        speakers—to
                        examine how age, individual differences and linguistic
                        background
                        influence sentence comprehension and syntactic
                        processing.</p>

                    <p>I hold an International Ph.D. in Linguistics <i>(Cum
                            Laude)</i> from the
                        University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). My
                        dissertation,<i>

                        doctoral
                        studies, I earned a B.A. in Translation and Interpreting
                        (University
                        of Málaga, Spain), and several master’s degrees: in

                        Experimental
                        Linguistics (UPV/EHU, Basque Country)—an academic path
                        shaped by my
                        inherently curious and inquisitive nature, and a
                        constant drive to
                        learn and explore new disciplines.</p>

                    <p>Before entering academia full-time, I taught in the
                        public
                        secondary education systems in Spain and France, founded
                        VCS
                        Traducciones and worked as a freelance translator for
                        institutions
                        such as CSIC, FISABIO, and KONGSBERG MARITIME.</p>

            <section class="w3-container seccion" id="investigacion">
                <div class="contenido">
                    <h1><b>Research</b></h1>
                    <p>My research centers on fundamental questions about how
                        language is
                        processed across the lifespan and how predictive
                        mechanisms support
                        comprehension. How do humans anticipate upcoming words
                        and
                        structures during real-time language processing? To what
                        extent are
                        these mechanisms affected by healthy aging, and how are
                        they shaped
                        by lifelong linguistic experience and cognitive
                        resources? To
                        address these questions, I have so far combined
                        behavioral and
                        attentional methods (e.g., eye-tracking) with an
                        increasing focus on
                        neuroimaging techniques (EEG, fMRI, MEG) to investigate
                        predictive
                        processing at both lexical and morphosyntactic levels.
                        While most of
                        my work has so far focused on sentence reading in
                        Spanish, I
                        aim to extend these findings to typologically diverse
                        languages in
                        order to generate cross-linguistically robust
                        conclusions.</p>

                    <h3>1. Healthy aging</h3>
                    <p>In the domain of healthy aging, my work examines how
                        age-related
                        changes in cognition interact with linguistic experience
                        to shape
                        predictive processing. Rather than assuming uniform
                        decline, I
                        investigate the balance between preserved abilities,
                        potential
                        improvements, and resource-driven limitations. My
                        findings suggest
                        that lexical prediction benefits more directly from
                        accumulated
                        linguistic experience, whereas morphosyntactic
                        prediction is more
                        constrained by working memory and attentional control.
                        By combining
                        eye-tracking evidence of real-time comprehension with
                        behavioral
                        data, I have shown that older adults’ prediction
                        abilities depend
                        not only on age but also on  individual
                        differences such as
                        vocabulary knowledge and reading habits. Building on
                        these insights,
                        my future research will integrate fMRI, MEG, and EEG to
                        capture the neural dynamics underlying predictive
                        mechanisms, thus
                        offering a more comprehensive view of performance and
                        brain activity
                        in aging. These efforts will also aim to determine when
                        along the
                        aging spectrum cognitive abilities begin to decline and
                        how
                        linguistic experience may offset such decline. In this
                        regard,
                        the study of older heritage speakers and late bilinguals
                        offers a particularly compelling opportunity. Late
                        bilinguals (e.g.,
                        Spanish speakers who immigrated to Latin America in
                        adulthood)
                        follow an aging trajectory similar to monolingual older
                        adults, but
                        their experience with Spanish grows more slowly.
                        Heritage speakers,
                        meanwhile, often process Spanish as a non-dominant
                        language, with
                        fewer resources and reduced literacy exposure, but
                        richer oral
                        language experience. Studying these populations will
                        allow me to
                        disentangle resource-based versus experience-based
                        effects on
                        predictive processing. My work on this topic has

                    <h3>2. Bilingualism & sociolinguistic perspective</h3>
                    <p>Beyond monolingual aging, I investigate how bilingualism
                        modulates
                        predictive processing. Lifelong management of two
                        languages may
                        reshape executive control and influence the balance
                        between lexical
                        and morphosyntactic prediction. Exploring these
                        questions helps
                        disentangle the interplay between cognitive resources
                        and language
                        experience, providing a broader understanding of how
                        language
                        processing adapts across diverse populations. Another
                            strand of
                            my research within this area has focused on
                            sociolinguistic
                            contexts, examining regional languages in Spain,
                        such as
                        Valencian/Catalan, to study the patterns of language use and
                        maintenance
                        among the youngest populations. This perspective
                        highlights the
                        importance of considering not only bilingualism itself,
                        but also the
                        sociolinguistic environments in which it develops. My
                        work on this

                    <h3>3. Language and neurodegenerative diseases</h3>
                    <p>While much of my work has focused on language in healthy
                        aging, I
                        am also deeply interested in how neurodegenerative
                        diseases affect
                        linguistic outcomes, particularly in conditions such as Mild Cognitive
                        Impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease, and aphasias. To do so, I plan 
                        to combine behavioral measures
                        with fMRI, MEG,
                        and EEG to examine both performance outcomes and the
                        neural
                        mechanisms underlying language decline.<p> 
                    <p>Based on the empirical findings of
                        my dissertation, which show that healthy aging is associated with
                        greater decline in morphosyntactic than lexical prediction, my current 
                        research agenda has two main short-to medium-term foci.<p>
                            
                    <p>First, I aim to examine how predictive mechanisms evolve in the
                        transition from healthy to pathological aging,
                        with particular focus on individuals with
                        amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI). In contrast
                        to healthy aging, emerging evidence suggest that aMCI is 
                        characterized by disproportionate impairment in lexical prediction
                        with relative preservation of morphosyntactic processing (project
                        currently being prepared for submission to competitive (inter)national
                        funding schemes).<p>
                        
                     <p>Second, a particular
                        focus will be
                        placed on grammatical processing, which has been less
                        studied in
                        healthy aging but is critically affected in certain
                        neurodegenerative conditions. For example, non-fluent
                        progressive
                        aphasia. This line of work allows me to link
                        grammatical deficits to the predictive
                        mechanisms and individual differences
                        identified in my doctoral research,
                        and to investigate which aspects of
                        linguistic experience and cognitive resources
                        may act as protective factors in
                        pathological aging.</p>
